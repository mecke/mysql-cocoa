READ ME file for MCPKit, from MySQL Cocoa project.
For the BINARIES distribution.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Aim of this Framework:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This framework is aimed at programers which want to connect to a MySQL database from a application developed with Cocoa (and maybe GNUStep, although I've not tried myself). The framework is based on the C API of MySQL and hence uses (or include) the libmysqlclient library coming from MySQL.

Objects from this framework (namely MCPConnection and MCPResult) belongs to the Model layer and uses anly the Foundation API. The development is done with XCode (the IDE from Apple -previously NeXT-), and no other environment is supported (yet !! if you want to port it to another env. I'll be glad to provide you with all the information I know which can help you).


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Flavours:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There is 2 flavours of the MCPKit framework:

1. The MCPKIT_bundled is there to be included in the bundle of Cocoa applications (so that they are as much as possible self-contained, not relying on 3rd party software to be installed independantly). 

2. The MCPKit_system is to be placed in one of the Library/Frameworks directory (/Library/Frameworks, ~//Library/Frameworks ...) and hence can be used when one wants to access MySQL from a Foundation tool (an Objective-C executable running from the command line, which can not have a bundle).

From version 3.0, these are the only two available version of the framework, and they both rely on a statically linked version of libmysqlclient.

+ Installation:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PLEASE, read the preceding section (Flavours) if you wounder which framework you want to use for your own application.

If you want to bundle MCPKit within your Cocoa application, you have to follow the steps described in the document (nicely provided by Dave Winter -http://davidwinter.me.uk/-):
http://mysql-cocoa.sf.net/documentation/mysql-cocoa_bundling_in_xcode.pdf

If you want to use the MCPKit for a command line tool, you have to install the MCPKit_system version of the framework, and place it in one of the Library/Frameworks directory.

In the source distribution, you'll find test case, which are a good starting point to how the framework works...
I currently have some trouble with the auto-generated documentation, as I'm trying to move away from the (old) autodoc to doxygen. So you'll have to wait to get the API reference documentation. Sorry about that.
